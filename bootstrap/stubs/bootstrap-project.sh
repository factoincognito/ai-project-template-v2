# bootstrap-project.sh: sets up a new project from this bootstrapper.
# Spec: "Turn-key bootstrap script" in
# https://github.com/factoincognito/ai-project-template-v2/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG.md
#
# Built so far: the inputs (options, questions, checks and defaults), the
# guided checks of this computer (bash, git, gh, npm, the git name and
# email, the target folder), the guided checks on GitHub (signed in, the
# current version of this script, the permissions gh has, the project
# name still free, the licence name), the plan and its "Proceed?"
# question, creating the project on GitHub and protecting its main
# version, the check that GitHub Actions is turned on for it, the copy of
# the project on this computer (with the git name and email, the line of work
# bootstrap-setup, the language pack laid out, the tidy-up, the
# placeholders filled in, the lockfile of the npm packs, the licence and
# the CHANGELOG entry), the self-check, saving the setup's changes,
# sending them to GitHub and proposing them there, waiting for the check
# build, making it required, adding the change to main, updating the
# copy, the report at the end, and the layout-pack subcommand; continuing
# a setup that stopped part way (--resume, which works out where to go on
# from GitHub and the copy on this computer, never from a file of its own),
# --allow-unprotected, the offer to make a private project public, the
# answers carried in the command shown at a stop, and the stop that says
# what exists when something unexpected happens or Ctrl-C is pressed.
#
# Usage:
#   bash bootstrap-project.sh [options]
#     Asks for each answer not given as an option, then checks them all.
#     --help lists the options; --non-interactive asks nothing.
#     --version prints the version and the commit it was built from.
#   bash bootstrap-project.sh layout-pack <node|web|python|react-native> <target-dir>
#     Lays out a language pack in <target-dir>, which must be empty or
#     absent. The packs are read from PACKS_DIR, by default the
#     languages/ folder next to this script.
#
# Exit codes: 0 done (or a --dry-run that passed its checks), 1 failed or
# stopped, 2 usage error, unknown pack, or an input that is missing or
# cannot be used, 3 a check of this computer or on GitHub did not pass, or
# a step on GitHub was refused: its steps were shown, with the command to
# start again (or, once the project exists, to continue with --resume).
# Runs on bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash): no associative arrays, no mapfile,
# no ${var,,}.
#
# Test hooks (environment variables the tests set; users leave them unset):
#   BOOTSTRAP_GH   the gh command to run (default: gh on the PATH).
#   BOOTSTRAP_RUN  a command that replaces the runner of the install and
#                  login commands the script offers. It gets the command
#                  as one argument, so the tests never install anything.
#   BOOTSTRAP_TTY  the terminal the yes to an offered command is read from
#                  (default: /dev/tty), never stdin.
#   BOOTSTRAP_OS_RELEASE  the Linux release file (default: /etc/os-release).
#   BOOTSTRAP_SLEEP  the command that waits between two checks of GitHub
#                  (default: sleep). It gets the seconds as its argument.
#   BOOTSTRAP_STDOUT_TERMINAL  yes or no: whether the output goes to a
#                  terminal, where the wait for build shows a * a second
#                  (default: asked of the shell, [ -t 1 ]).
#   BOOTSTRAP_NPM  the npm the lockfile step runs (default: npm on the
#                  PATH), so the tests never reach the npm registry. The
#                  check that npm is installed runs the npm on the PATH.
#   BOOTSTRAP_COLOR  set (not empty): the lines the user acts on are in
#                  colour as at a terminal, though the output goes to a
#                  file. NO_COLOR, set and not empty, and TERM=dumb still
#                  turn colour off (see colour_on).
#
# Sourcing this file defines its functions and runs nothing (the tests
# load it that way); running it with bash runs the main part at the end.

# ---------- preflight: checks on this computer ----------
# Before anything is created the script checks this computer (spec:
# "Preflight (guided)"). A check that fails shows a guide: numbered steps
# for this OS, why the step is needed, what the user sees when it worked,
# what to do otherwise and how the script checks it. Then it waits for
# Enter and checks again, until the check passes or the user stops; on
# stop it shows the command to start again and exits 3. With
# --non-interactive it shows the guide and exits 3 at once. Where the
# script can run the fix itself (an install), the guide sets OFFER and the
# script offers the command on each round (not straight after it ran),
# running it only after a yes typed at the terminal (ask_terminal): never
# from stdin, never because of --yes.
#
# guided_check <check> <guide> is the loop; the GitHub checks reuse it.
# A check returns 0 when it passes; a guide prints through guide_begin,
# guide_step, say_command and guide_end, and may set OFFER.

# ---------- the self-check, saving, sending and proposing the change ----------
# Spec steps 12, 13 and 14. The self-check stops before anything is saved
# when a text of the fill table is left in its file, when git status
# shows a path the setup does not change, when the changes hold what
# looks like a GitHub key, or when a file has a carriage return. Then the
# git name and email are checked, the change "Set up <name>" is saved
# (committed) and sent (pushed) on bootstrap-setup, and proposed on GitHub
# (gh pr create, with its title and body given, so gh asks nothing).
#
# Signing in (step 13): for the push, git borrows gh's sign-in for that
# one command, through -c, so no git settings change: an empty
# credential.https://github.com.helper drops the helpers set before it,
# then gh's own helper. These are the two settings gh auth setup-git
# writes into the global git settings (gh 2.89.0, run once into a
# throwaway settings file), with the gh this script runs. When git still
# cannot sign in, guide_git_sign_in offers gh auth setup-git itself,
# which changes the global git settings: the guide says so, and it runs
# only after a yes typed at the terminal. Later tries then push without
# the -c settings, which would hide the helper gh auth setup-git (or the
# user) set. The copy (step 4) gets the same guide. git never asks at the
# terminal (GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0): it would wait there, or read answers
# meant for the script.
#
# No key is ever shown, saved or written (spec, "No secrets"): the
# checks name the files that hold one, never the key, and the sign-in
# helper is a command, not a key.
